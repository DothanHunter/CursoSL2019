2) The javascript code can be invoked by sending a request to the url like /b1s/v1/script/test/{{javascript file without prefix}}
   For example, to run the function GET in test_items.js, send a request as below:
   GET /b1s/v1/script/test/test_items
   Please be aware this is just for the test purpose !!!
   In the production environment, the script file should have an ard file and be uploaded into extension manager.
